# Pi-approximation

Code is found in the master branch

This is a simple approximation of pi using the overlaping areas of a unit circle and a square of surface area 4.

The idea is to generate random points inside the square and to find the ratio between points outside and points inside the circle.

As many points are generated the ratio will give an approximation as to how much of the total are is occupied by the circle.

Multiplying this number by 4 gives us an approximation of pi.

This was made just for fun and is nowhere near optimized. I might go back to this in the future to make it better.
